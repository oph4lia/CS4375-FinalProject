# CS4375.501 Final Project
> Mikkael Dumancas

## Brainstorming Proposals

There are 3 options for this project
1. Classification on structured datasets
2. NLP and text classification
3. Option of your choice

Given these options, I went with option 3. The premise of my project is building a **Reinforcement Learning Agent** to play the google chrome web game, Dino Run (also known as the "no internet" game).

## Understanding Reinforecement Learning

Here is a simple explanation taken from the documentation of [*Gymnasium*](https://gymnasium.farama.org/introduction/basic_usage/), an OpenAI API built to support single agent reinforcement learning environments:

> "The agent receives an observation about the environment, the agent then selects an action, which the environment uses to determine the reward and the next observation. The cycle then repeats itself until the environment ends (terminates)."

Simply put, reinforcement learning is a simple approach to ML that involves the core concept of a reward. An RL model (or agent) seeks to maximize this reward signal via continuous decisions made on observations.
